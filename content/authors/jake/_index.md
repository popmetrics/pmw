I am a senior epidemiologist working in enhanced COVID-19 surveillance with the California Department of Global Health. I am also a visiting scientist with the Center for Inferctious Disease Research Zambia (CIDRZ) and serve as part-time adjunct faculty for the University of California, Davis School of Medicine. My experience as an epidemiologist has been diverse including SARS-CoV-2 research in the state of California, as a regional communicable disease surveillance epidemiologist in Northern California, and HIV implementation science research in Zambia. In California my research has revolved around better understanding the relationship between community exposures and SARS-CoV-2 transmission and COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness in the ever-changing context of SARS-CoV-2 variants circulating. Abroad my research has coalesced around HIV/non-communicable disease (NCD) co-morbidity, especially hypertension and chronic kidney disease. I have practiced a One Health/Planetary Health approach to understand a more comprehensive consideration of potential etiologies for chronic kidney disease of uknown etiology (CKDu) in Sri Lanka. In addition, I have analyzed outcomes for a large project implementing four HIV differentiated service deliever models. Previous work has largely focused on persons living with HIV however, I am currently funded through the Center for Disease Control and Preventionâ€™s (CDC) epidemiology and laboratory capacity. I have an extensive knowledge of the national HIV electronic medical record in Zambia that I am able to apply to novel linkage projects including HIV self-testing outcomes. I have mentored young Zambian scientists to translate program implementation into peer reviewed abstracts and manuscripts. In summary, I am interested in leveraging the vast bodies of exisiting programmatic data to optimize public health in both well-resourced and limited-resource settings.
